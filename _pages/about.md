Agile Denver is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit that serves the Agile Software Development
community in Denver and along Colorado's Front Range.

The organization is best known for its annual conference, Mile High Agile. [Last
year's conference](http://milehighagile2015.agiledenver.org) featured 850
attendees, two keynote speakers by Rod Collins and Mike Cohn, a sit-down lunch
and a few dozen presentations by the best agile thinkers in the nation.

Each month, Agile Denver hosts a handful of meetings geared toward the agile
practitioner. Our monthly meetings are held downtown at the Tivoli Student
Center on the Auraria Campus. Recent speakers included Tommy Norman, Rod Claar,
Brad Swanson, Jake Calabrese, Erin Beierwaltes and Craig Larman. Find out more
by visiting our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Denver) site.

If that's not enough to get you interested, Agile Denver also sponsors a number
of special interest groups (SIG). Looking for information on lean and Kanban?
Coaching? Scrum Master excellence? There is a SIG for you!

Most SIGs advertise their meetings on Meetup, but some also use our
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Agile-Denver-158624) group. The
LinkedIn group is a good place to connect with the community between meetings.

Agile Denver is an entirely volunteer-run organization.
